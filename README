This project estimates the age of a person given the frontal face image and also give an estimation of the persons emotion based on the image supplied. 

<===============================**Installation:**=====================================>
                                **Prerequisites**
1. python 2.7
2. Dlib- pip install dlib
3. scikit-learn:- It has a lengthy installation process with some dependencies of its own.
So download and install anaconda2 which will install scikit learn along with all its dependencies.
steps to install scikit-learn can be found in the following link:http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html
4.scikit-image:- pip install scikit-image OR if you are using conda
conda install scikit-image
5.numpy:- will be already installed with anaconda2
6.pickle:- most probably its already installed with anaconda2

<====================================Run===================================>
Age estimation:-
Run the testing.py file for age detection after adding your frontal face image in the image/testing folder.
Emotion estimation:-
Run the testing.py file for emotion detection after adding your frontal face image in the image/testing folder.


<=================================Retraining the SVM============================>
